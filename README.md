## Information and Inspiration


Early Inspiration came from Webby of weboas.is (RIP)

Lots of resources have come from FMHY Reddit and Divolt Channels (Shout out to @nbats)

Big Shoutout For The OSINT Resources goes out to Dean Da Costa and technisette



- This is very much an ongoing WIP, Theres Over 16,0000 Bookmarks I’ve Been Updating and Collecting Since 2008.
- There’s Definitely Something Here For Everyone, If you Have Enough Time and Effort To Find It.
- My Goal Is To Turn This Into a Searchable and Visual Wiki/Digital Garden.
- All Bookmarks Have Been Exported From my Raindrop.io Account and Imported into Obsidian.
- Currently uploading from Obsidian directly to Github.
